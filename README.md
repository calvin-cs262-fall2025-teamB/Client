# Calvin GeoCaching

Our team is building a Calvin geocaching and collectathon app that transforms campus into an interactive adventure. Students can explore by collecting virtual tokens at GPS locations tied to landmarks, buildings, and hidden spots, or by solving puzzles that unlock new coordinates. Users can also create their own landmarks and custom scavenger hunts, allowing the community to design challenges for others and share unique experiences. A map-based interface, digital gallery (“Calvin-dex”), and rewards such as badges, streaks, and leaderboards will encourage discovery, problem-solving, and friendly competition.

While apps like Pokémon GO or general geocaching platforms provide broad, global experiences, they lack customization for local environments and persistent community engagement. Traditional scavenger hunt apps often offer only one-off experiences. Our app fills this gap by combining location-based gameplay, puzzle-solving, and community-generated content tailored to campus life. Beyond Calvin, the platform could scale to schools, museums, and local communities, supporting orientation activities, tourism, and interactive cultural events.
