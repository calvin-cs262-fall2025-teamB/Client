## Introduction

Thank you for agreeing to test WayFind, our location-based adventure game. We want to see first-hand what it's like for real people to use the app, which will help us improve it before launch.

**Important things to know:**

We're testing the app, not you. You can't do anything wrong here. We want to hear exactly what you think. Be honest and don't worry about hurting our feelings. That will help us find problems and fix them.

For the test, we'll ask you to do certain tasks and we'd like you to **think out loud** while you're doing them. If you have questions, just ask. If you have comments, go ahead and say them. We'll record your feedback, but won't make it public. If, for any reason, you'd like to quit this test, just say so.

**What is WayFind?**

WayFind is a mobile game that turns real-world locations into interactive treasure hunts. Think geocaching meets mobile gaming. In this prototype, you can:

- Browse and search for adventures created by others
- View adventure details including difficulty, duration, and token counts
- See your profile statistics (tokens collected, adventures completed)
- Explore the map and creation tools for building new adventures
- Filter adventures by difficulty, duration, and region

**Key terms you'll encounter:**

- **Region:** A geographic area (like "Calvin Campus") that contains adventures
- **Adventure:** A planned route with specific locations to visit and tokens to collect
- **Token:** A collectible item at a specific GPS location (collected during adventure gameplay)
- **Difficulty:** How challenging the adventure is (Easy, Medium, Hard)

## Background Questions

We presume that you use mobile apps regularly.

1. Have you ever played location-based games like Pokémon GO, geocaching apps, or similar? If so, what did you like or dislike about them?

2. Have you spent much time creating or sharing content in apps or games (like levels, routes, posts)? If so, what was that experience like?

3. What motivates you to explore outdoor locations? (Exercise, socializing, competition, discovery, etc.)

Before we begin, do you have any questions for me?

**Remember:** Please think out loud as you work through the tasks. Tell us what you're looking at, what you expect to happen, what confuses you, and what you like or don't like.

## The Test

### 1. First Impressions

Open the WayFind app for the first time and tell us your general impression. What do you notice? Are you tempted to tap on anything? Is it clear what the app does?

### 2. General Tasks

I'll ask you to do some of the following tasks, depending on how much time we have:

**a) Getting Started**
You've just downloaded WayFind. Create an account and get to the main screen where you can explore adventures.

**b) Browsing Adventures**
Look through the available adventures. What information do you see about each adventure? What makes one adventure more appealing than another?

**c) Searching for Adventures**
Find an adventure that sounds interesting to you using the search feature. Try searching for keywords that appeal to you.

**d) Filtering Adventures**
You want to find a short, easy adventure. Use the filter system to narrow down the list. Can you find adventures based on difficulty or time commitment?

**e) Understanding Adventure Details**
Pick an adventure and view its full details. What information can you find about it? How many tokens would you collect? How difficult is it? How long would it take?

**f) Checking Your Profile**
Find out how many adventures you've completed and how many tokens you've collected. Where can you see your personal statistics?

**g) Viewing Your Completed Adventures**
Look at the list of adventures you've already completed. Can you see what adventures you've finished?

**h) Exploring the Map**
Navigate to the map screen. What do you see? Can you tell where you are? What features or tools are available on the map?

**i) Understanding Creation Features**
You want to create your own adventure for others to explore. Find where you would start this process. What options or tools are available for creating content?

**j) Managing Your Account**
Find where you can view or edit your personal information (name, email). Where would you go to log out of the app?

### 3. Final Observations

Do you have any final observations on the app? Would you consider using it? What would make you want to use it regularly or recommend it to friends?

## Thanks

Many thanks for your willingness to help us test WayFind. The app is still a prototype, so we really appreciate your help in improving it.

We'll keep the data from your session private and will only share aggregate findings with our team. Your honest feedback today will directly influence how we refine the app and make it more enjoyable for users.

If you're interested, we'd love to have you try the app again once we've made improvements based on your feedback. Thanks again for your time!
