## Introduction

Thank you for agreeing to test WayFind, our location-based adventure game. We want to see first-hand what it's like for real people to use the app, which will help us improve it before launch.

**Important things to know:**

We're testing the app, not you. You can't do anything wrong here. We want to hear exactly what you think. Be honest and don't worry about hurting our feelings. That will help us find problems and fix them.

For the test, we'll ask you to do certain tasks and we'd like you to **think out loud** while you're doing them. If you have questions, just ask. If you have comments, go ahead and say them. We'll record your feedback, but won't make it public. If, for any reason, you'd like to quit this test, just say so.

**What is WayFind?**

WayFind is a mobile game that turns real-world locations into interactive treasure hunts. Think geocaching meets mobile gaming. Users can:
- Discover adventures created by others near their location
- Follow GPS-guided paths to find hidden "tokens" at specific places
- Create their own adventures for others to explore
- Earn achievements by completing different adventure paths

**Key terms you'll encounter:**
- **Region:** A geographic area (like "Calvin Campus") that contains adventures
- **Adventure:** A sequence of locations you visit to collect tokens
- **Token:** A collectible item found at a specific GPS location
- **Proximity:** The app detects when you're close enough to collect a token

## Background Questions

We presume that you use mobile apps regularly.

1. Have you ever played location-based games like Pokémon GO, geocaching apps, or similar? If so, what did you like or dislike about them?

2. Have you spent much time creating or sharing content in apps or games (like levels, routes, posts)? If so, what was that experience like?

3. What motivates you to explore outdoor locations? (Exercise, socializing, competition, discovery, etc.)

Before we begin, do you have any questions for me?

**Remember:** Please think out loud as you work through the tasks. Tell us what you're looking at, what you expect to happen, what confuses you, and what you like or don't like.

## The Test

### 1. First Impressions
Open the WayFind app for the first time and tell us your general impression. What do you notice? Are you tempted to tap on anything? Is it clear what the app does?

### 2. General Tasks
I'll ask you to do some of the following tasks, depending on how much time we have:

**a) Getting Started**
You've just downloaded WayFind. Get to the point where you could start exploring adventures.

**b) Finding an Adventure**
Find an adventure near your current location that looks interesting to you. What makes it appealing (or not)?

**c) Understanding Adventure Details**
Pick an adventure and figure out what it involves. How many locations would you visit? Where are they? How difficult is it?

**d) Viewing the Route**
For the adventure you selected, find out where you would need to go to complete it. Can you see the path or locations on a map?

**e) Starting an Adventure**
You've decided to try this adventure. Start it and figure out what you need to do first.

**f) Checking Your Progress**
Find out how many adventures you've completed and what achievements you've earned.

**g) Creating Your Own Adventure**
You want to create a treasure hunt around campus for your friends. Start the process of creating an adventure and tell us what information you think you need to provide.

**h) Finding Help or Instructions**
Imagine you're stuck during an adventure and can't find a token. Where would you look for help or hints?

**i) Sharing with Friends**
You've completed an adventure and want to tell your friend about it. How would you share it with them?

### 3. Final Observations
Do you have any final observations on the app? Would you consider using it? What would make you want to use it regularly or recommend it to friends?

## Thanks

Many thanks for your willingness to help us test WayFind. The app is still a prototype, so we really appreciate your help in improving it.

We'll keep the data from your session private and will only share aggregate findings with our team. Your honest feedback today will directly influence how we refine the app and make it more enjoyable for users.

If you're interested, we'd love to have you try the app again once we've made improvements based on your feedback. Thanks again for your time!
